Try using powershell to the max please :)

Open powershell as administrator by searching on start and right clicking on it
then use these commands:

--> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

(if this doesnt work, then use cmd, run as adminstrator by right clicking then use this command:

--> @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"


***try not to use this for uniformity***)
--------------------------------------------------------
Then in the same powershell

--> choco install openssh

go to the folder which has ccbdprojectsav.pem(This is a very important file apparently so keep it somewhere safe)

--> $path = ".\ccbdprojectsav.pem"

--> icacls.exe $path /reset

--> icacls.exe $path /GRANT:R "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"

--> icacls.exe $path /inheritance:r

(these are initial steps for a newly created instance, need not be done everytime)
------------------------------------------------------

(for connecting always use this)

--> ssh -i "ccbdprojectsav.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-226-253-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com


btw before all this, check if the instances are running on aws and if the ip address is matching or not
